      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Jesse LoCascio. Currently, I'm on an exciting journey
        as a full-stack web developer. My path began with a strong foundation in
        the arts, as I hold a BFA in Visual Arts with a concentration in Visual
        Communications (in simpler terms, I have a Graphic Design degree). This
        creative background fuels my passion for web development, where design
        and code come together in a really enticing way.
        <br></br>My journey has been a dynamic one. I've been a pioneer in the
        pilot program for an AP Computer Science class in high school, led club
        events and workshops as a club president in college, and eagerly
        attended a range of technology conventions after college. Each
        experience has been a stepping stone in my pursuit of excellence in this
        new field. As I move forward, I'm committed to providing fresh insights
        and innovative solutions to the ever-evolving world of web development.
        Join me as we explore the limitless possibilities of this digital
        landscape.
